== Vision

I hope all y'all get to learn F#.

== Steps

Most people start by writing a "Hello, World" program. In F#, it looks like this:

[source, bash]
----
// hello
echo "Hello, World!"
----

[source, bash]
----
// goodbye.sh
echo "Goodbye, World!"
----

[source, fsharp]
----
// hello.fs
printfn "Hello, World!"
----

[source, fsharp]
----
printfn "Goodbye, World!"
----

[source, fsharp]
----
printfn "Screw you, World!"
----

[source, fsharp]
----
printfn "Manure, World!"
----
